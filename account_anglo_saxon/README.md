# What is Anglo-Saxon Accounting

Anglo-saxon accounting is used in most non-continental countries. With anglo-saxon
accounting, the costs associated with a sale are posted as part of the invoice rather
than being accounted for by the reduction in inventory at month end.

# What this module does

There is a long history in Odoo with issues around anglo-saxon accounting, and
this module fixes issues that Odoo will not fix.

In particular, it resolves the accounting entries arising from financial invoices
and credits and distinct from stock invoices and credits.

It also provides a wizard to automate the reconciling of the Dispatched Not Invoiced
account and provide reporting on the balance.

# Set Up

There are default values that are set by company on the company form.
